# PickLock
An locking software that allows the user to unlock their device by clicking at the correct images which is generated through an API based on the input feed like google captcha. It was built by me to solve the issue of people forgetting pins, strings, and the chances of it being hacked by people peeking over your shoulder

This software is a web app which uses JS for basic algorithms and Unsplash API to generate random images.
